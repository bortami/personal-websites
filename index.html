        <h3>Just some words</h3>
    <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Get tough with it, get strong. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

    <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You gotta think like a tree.</p>

    <h3>Work History</h3>
    <h4>Work #1  - That's not soon enough!</h4><article>
    Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
    </article><h4>Work #2 - Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe!</h4>
    <article>
    I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Ow, my spirit!</article>
    <h4>Work #3 - Oh sure! Blame the wizards!</h4>
    <article>Ummm…to eBay? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Noooooo! Nooo ooo! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?You are the last hope of the universe. I love you, buddy! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Pansy. Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</article>
