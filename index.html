        <h3>Just some words</h3>
    <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Get tough with it, get strong. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</p>

    <p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You gotta think like a tree.</p>
